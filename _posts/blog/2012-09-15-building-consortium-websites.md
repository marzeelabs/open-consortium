<p class="lead">Your consortium website is probably the most important communication tool you have. Open Consortium specializes in building good-looking, feature-rich websites for your scientific consortium, so you can focus on what you are good at and not worry about your website.</p> 

As the consortium coordinator, you would use your website to show new publications, coverage in the press, and announce events like your next consortium meeting. As a consortium partner, you would use it to advertise yourself and your science topics, and look for pre- and postdoctoral candidates to join your lab. And as a visitor, you would use it to learn about the work the consortium is doing. Similar requirements shared by every scientific consortium. That is why Open Consortium has built a website template that addresses all this needs and is easily managed by yourself, not requiring technical expertise.

<!-- #### Highlight researchers and their research -->

Every researcher has a profile that can be easily updated by themselves. No need to ask everyone to send you Word documents with their biography, current research topics and some selected publications.

<!-- #### Visualize your network -->

There is no better way to visualize your consortium network than putting it on map.

<!-- #### Built using open-source technologies -->

Built on [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org), the [hottest web content system in education today](https://www.acquia.com/five-data-sheets-promoting-drupal), the website can be extended with some of the 5000+ available modules. And probably your institution has someone that is skilled in Drupal to help you out with your technical needs.
