<p class="lead">Your consortium website is probably the most important communication tool you have. We recently launched our first Open Consortium website built on our <a href="/technology.html">technology package</a>, for a European research network training new researchers in male reproductive biology and andrology.</p> 

Every scientific consortium needs an website. These websites often must be independent from the research institutes participating in the consortium, and are managed by one of the research institutes participating in the consortium, the _coordinator_. Their needs center around creating a place to publicize the research being conducted, the researchers involved in the project, and as a tool to attract talented young researchers to join the network.

We built such a website for <a href="http://reprotrain.eu" target="_blank">Reprotrain</a>, a Marie Curie training network funded by the 7th Framework Programme. The network aims to provide train researchers in solving problems relating to Male Reproductive Biology and Andrology, hence the use of _sperm cells_ as the identity of the project. Seven research groups and two academic institutes from six countries participate in the consortium, and the consortium is managed by the group of <a href="#">Rafael Olivia</a> from the <a href="http://www.idibaps.org" target="_blank">IDIBPABS</a> research center in Barcelona, Spain.

The website has been built on Drupal 7 and the content is written and maintained by <a href="http://reprotrain.eu/contact" target="_blank">Valeria de Azcoitia</a>, Reprotrain's project manager. It has a [job application system](http://reprotrain.eu/jobs), partner descriptions, dynamic news and events, and much more. Best of all, it looks great on all devices.

Building these sites has been a lot of fun, thanks to the enthusiasm of Veronica Raker
  
  specializes in building good-looking, feature-rich websites for your scientific consortium, so you can focus on what you are good at and not worry about your website.</p> 

As the consortium coordinator, you would use your website to show new publications, coverage in the press, and announce events like your next consortium meeting. As a consortium partner, you would use it to advertise yourself and your science topics, and look for pre- and postdoctoral candidates to join your lab. And as a visitor, you would use it to learn about the work the consortium is doing. Similar requirements shared by every scientific consortium. That is why Open Consortium has built a website template that addresses all this needs and is easily managed by yourself, not requiring technical expertise. -->

<!-- #### Built using open-source technologies -->

<!-- Built on [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org), the [hottest web content system in education today](https://www.acquia.com/five-data-sheets-promoting-drupal), the website can be extended with some of the 5000+ available modules. And probably your institution has someone that is skilled in Drupal to help you out with your technical needs.  -->
