_Tobias introducing Open Consortium (left) and Peter on the creation of data hubs using Drupal and Open Data (right)._

We presented at the topic stream [Open Data in Business Research](http://okfestival.org/open-data-in-business-research/) together with Maria Krestyaninova from [Simbioms](http://simbioms.org), who showcased technology to manage large sets of data within scientific consortia. We hope to be able to contribute to the open data movement in the future (e.g. by building on the open data provided by the European Commission) and make science in Europe more accessible, understandable and transparent to the general public.
