Peter Vanhee (MSc, PhD) is a co-founder of Open Consortium and technology expert. Peter always combined his scientific career with his passion for technology. He has [published](http://tinyurl.com/vanheepapers) in critically acclaimed journals on his work in computational protein design, and is an influential [contributor](http://drupal.org/user/108811) to open-source projects, such as the popular content management system [Drupal](http://drupal.org). Since his involvement in the European organization [<abbr title="Erasmus Student Network">ESN</abbr>](http://esn.org), he has had a keen interest in European matters. He was one of the founders of the highly successful ESN Satellite, a website template that revolutionized the web presence of the organization. That success led him to set up the not-for-profit organization [Youth Agora](http://youthagora.org) and the web agency [Nuvole](http://nuvole.org). Nowadays, he is putting most of his energy in [Marzee Labs](http://marzeelabs.org), an international web agency from Barcelona. His work as a researcher in academia always went hand-in hand with entrepreneurial activities. Peter’s comprehensive vision of communication needs of contemporary research & innovation partnerships comes from practical experience as a scientist, an IT specialist and a businessman.



<!--
Peter is working with Drupal since version 4.7 when Drupal was barely known to the larger public. He learnt PHP with the elegant MVC framework CakePHP. In 2007, together with Antonio and Andrea, he worked on what was at that time one of the first templates for Drupal: ESN Satellite. Since its inception, the template website targeted at student sections from the Erasmus Student Network has revolutionized the web presence of the network. That success led him to set up the not-for-profit organization Youth Agora in 2008, together with Antonio, Andrea and Christof. Youth Agora participates in various exciting European Projects, building online youth platforms such as Sheryica or the international Masters Course Template within the Europan Campus project.
Peter's background is in Computer Science, with a special interest for Artificial Intelligence. Since 2007 he is working on his PhD in Bioinformatics, discovering a new exciting world of structural biology and applying his practical insights in programming to predict interactions between proteins. Currently he is working in the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park and, in his free time, contributes his Drupal experience to Nuvole.



Peter Vanhee (MSc, PhD) a co-founder of openconsortium.eu has more than 5 years experience as a web engineer, specializing in Drupal development.
