Peter is working with Drupal since version 4.7 when Drupal was barely known to the larger public. He learnt PHP with the elegant MVC framework CakePHP. In 2007, together with Antonio and Andrea, he worked on what was at that time one of the first templates for Drupal: ESN Satellite. Since its inception, the template website targeted at student sections from the Erasmus Student Network has revolutionized the web presence of the network. That success led him to set up the not-for-profit organization Youth Agora in 2008, together with Antonio, Andrea and Christof. Youth Agora participates in various exciting European Projects, building online youth platforms such as Sheryica or the international Masters Course Template within the Europan Campus project.
Peter's background is in Computer Science, with a special interest for Artificial Intelligence. Since 2007 he is working on his PhD in Bioinformatics, discovering a new exciting world of structural biology and applying his practical insights in programming to predict interactions between proteins. Currently he is working in the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park and, in his free time, contributes his Drupal experience to Nuvole.
