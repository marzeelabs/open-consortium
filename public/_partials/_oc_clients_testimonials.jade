    .clients-testimonial We manage several collaborative projects and we need to promote their visibility and disseminate their results on the web. Open Consortium provides us with an easy-to-implement, tailored solution which allows us (and our collaborators) to edit and manage content in an extremely user-friendly interface. Our websites always look neat and accessible

    .clients-testimonial  Our goal, in terms of a website, was to have something allowing us to manage, and populate the content ourselves at our pace.

We found in Open Consortium just that, a tool fit for us, manageable, intuitive, robust, that covered our needs, and on top of all that we never had lack of support.
