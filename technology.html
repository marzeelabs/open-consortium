        <h3>Highlight researchers and their research</h3>
        <p>
          Every researcher has a profile that they can easily update. No need to ask everyone to send you Word documents with biography, current research topics or selected publications. And you can announce your jobs on the website so you can hire talented researchers for your Consortium. <span class="badge">Website Package</span>

        <h3>You build your website yourself</h3>
        <p>
          Nobody knows better than you what you want to show on your website, so why don't you build the site yourself? Powered by the popular <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> content management system, you can add all the content yourself, whether these are pages, menus, researcher profiles, job openings or projects. We can host the site on our servers, or you can host it at your institute. <span class="badge">Website Package</span>
